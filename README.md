hello! this is my first attempt at coding a website for the UI/UX Bootcamp in the University of Toronto. 
I'm still relatively new at this; I just learned the basics of HTML and CSS for the past 2 weeks.
it was kind of a struggle to learn it at first glance, since i had to leave to meet my folks up at Calgary but you know, it is what it is i guess.
primarily got help from the class notes/recordings/activities and in the and it was pretty fun!
